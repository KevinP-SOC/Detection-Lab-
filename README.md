# SOC Detection Lab-

## Objective

The SOC Detection Lab was created to build a safe, virtualized environment for simulating cyber attacks and practicing defensive monitoring techniques. The project focused on configuring Windows 10 and Kali Linux virtual machines, generating malicious and suspicious activity, and collecting telemetry with Sysmon and Splunk. The goal was to understand how attacks appear in logs, develop detection strategies, and strengthen practical SOC analyst skills.

### Skills Learned

-Gained practical experience configuring and managing a virtualized SOC environment in VirtualBox.
-Installed and tuned Sysmon to capture detailed Windows telemetry for security monitoring.
-Ingested, parsed, and analyzed logs in Splunk, applying SIEM concepts to real-world scenarios.
-Practiced interpreting event logs to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), attack patterns, and signatures.
-Strengthened understanding of network protocols, vulnerabilities, and adversary behaviors through simulated attacks.
-Developed detection queries and alerts to monitor suspicious activity.
-Improved critical thinking and problem-solving skills while investigating simulated incidents.

### Tools Used

-VirtualBox – virtualization platform for lab setup.
-Windows 10 + Sysmon – endpoint telemetry generation.
-Splunk – SIEM for log ingestion, search, and analysis.
-Kali Linux – attacker machine (Nmap, Metasploit, reverse shell payloads).
-Wireshark – optional packet analysis for network visibility.
